# DigiBloom

A digital garden for planting and sharing positive messages.

## What is this?

**DigiBloom** is a communal space where people can plant virtual flowers, each carrying a message of kindness, encouragement, or hope. Click anywhere on the garden to plant a flower, write your message, and watch it join the others in an ever-growing field.

This isn't a product. There are no accounts, no metrics, no engagement hooks. Just a quiet corner of the internet where people leave notes for strangers.

## Features

* **Plant flowers** — Choose from tulips, roses, sunflowers, carnations, forget-me-nots, and lilies
* **Share messages** — Each flower holds a title, message, and optional author name
* **Browse the garden** — Scroll through an infinite horizontal garden to discover what others have planted
* **Share individual flowers** — Every flower has its own URL for sharing on social media
* **Ambient experience** — Lofi music, drifting clouds, a blinking sun, and gently swaying flowers

## Philosophy

The internet has enough apps designed to capture attention and extract value. **DigiBloom** is intentionally simple — a place to give rather than take. Plant something kind and move on, or stay a while and read what others have shared.

**No ads. No data harvesting. No growth hacking. Just flowers.**
